This may involve shifting resources from less effective campaigns or regions to those showing better performance or higher potential. 4. **Enhance Customer Retention Programs:** Implement targeted customer retention programs specifically for Tier-2 cities, focusing on post-acquisition engagement, customer service, and value proposition reinforcement. 5. **Monitor Operational Costs:** Implement stricter cost controls and performance tracking for marketing initiatives to ensure that increased operational costs are justified by measurable business outcomes."

Consider shifting focus from broad campaigns to more targeted, retention-focused initiatives or exploring different marketing channels that resonate better with the Tier-2 audience. 3. **Analyze Operational Cost Drivers:** Conduct a detailed analysis of operational cost increases to identify specific components beyond marketing efforts that contributed to the rise. This will allow for more precise cost-saving measures. 4. **Refine Measurement and Attribution:** Implement more robust tracking and attribution models to better understand the direct impact of specific marketing campaigns on engagement, conversion, and churn across all regions, controlling for external factors."
